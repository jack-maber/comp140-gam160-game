**General Game Idea Overview**

My game idea will be centered around the player piloting a mech in an arena type area littered with obstacles and enemies trying to stop the player from defusing a number of bombs randomely placed in the arena, with the player's objective being to defuse the bombs before the individual timers run out and detract from the arena's health bar, with the amount of enemies increasing with every round, the player will have to face this enslaught using a variety of weapons and attacks until the health bar runs out and the arena is destroyed, the player is then left with a highscore that can be entered into the highscore table
