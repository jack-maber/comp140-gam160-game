**General Game Idea Overview**

My game idea will be centred around the player piloting a mech in an neo-80s style arena type area littered with obstacles and enemies trying to stop the player from defusing a number of bombs randomly placed in the arena, with the player's objective being to defuse the bombs before the individual timers run out and detract from the arena's health bar, with the amount of enemies increasing with every round, the player will have to face this onslaught using a variety of weapons and attacks until the health bar runs out and the arena is destroyed, the player is then left with a score that can be entered into the high score table and be used to compare their skill and prowess to their peers and provide a competitive element to the game.

**Core Game Mechanics**

Movement in the game will be handled in the normal FPS manner with the left stick handling the direction  of the character's movement while the right stick aims the mechs weapon, however the weapon can be rotated a full 360 degrees and can be aimed independently of the mechs legs, adding a new level of mobility unseen in a game of this type and completely changing the way the game is played.

The players main objective while in play is to defuse the bombs that are randomly placed around the environment at the start of every round, the way that these are defused is a small mini-game which takes place in real time so the player has to be smart about when they defuse, the mini game will require the player to hit a number of directional inputs in order under a time limit with the time left being displayed by a decreasing bar, and if it runs out the player will have to retry it with another set of randomly selected inputs to add to the challenge and the pressure, and adding variety to the gameplay, with the round ending either when all the bombs have been defused or exploded and dealt their damage. 

The other core game mechanic will be the arena's health bar system, where instead of dealing damage to the player and the game ending when they die, they will instead respawn after a set amount of time, letting the bomb timers count down and put the player under more pressure, the way the game will end is when the arena's health bar reaches zero, the player will be able to rebuild pieces and return health but it will take time and they will be open to attack while they are doing it.  

# comp140-gam160-Controller Research

**Research into existing controllers**
As my game will require the use of joysticks to control the player character, I thoguht it would be fitting to research into alternative controllers that make use of these devices, the first controller I found was quite close to what my controller will hopefully operate like; BiDUL (http://shakethatbutton.com/bidul/) is controller that utilises 3 seperate joysticks that are used to control seperate parts of a robot while you explore a planet, with the left and right sticks controlling the legs and the top being used for the flight controls, while my robot will control differently, with one stick controlling movement and the other controlling where it looks, the principle of the control method remains, although I think that I would mount the joysticks simply side by side with my others controls in the middle for ease of use and manufacture. 

The next alternative controller that spiked my interest was The Winds Of Venus (http://shakethatbutton.com/the-winds-of-venus/), although the game it controls is not very similar to what I am going for, the use of analogue controls is what drew me in, with a whole lot of toggle switches and pots used to interact with the game, these are the types of controls that I want to incorporate into my controllers, especially for the hacking minigame part of my prototype as I find that having the player push actual buttons that correspond to the actions displayed on screen, rather than just hitting keys on a keyboard as it provides better feedback and is much more immersive. 

The last controller that I researched was the Steel Batallion controller (https://tinyurl.com/j5gx3ku), although not a homebrew device, it technically is an "alternative controller", this is closest controller I can find to the image in my mind of what I want my device to look like, although not as with many buttons, but the heavy use of joysticks and toggle switches is what it to my attention and the fact that it is used to control a game in a similar vein to my own, the way it's designed and the hardware that it uses will defienetly aid me in my own design process 

**Physical Controller Description**
My controller will require the use of a large base to give adequate room for all of the controls and allow for a decent amount of space between the sticks so that the player's hands do not collide and affect the inputs. The joysticks would be only slightly higher than the tops of the player's hands to allow them to depress the buttons on top to fire the weapons. In the space inbetween the sticks will be the keypad that the player will use to defuse the bomb and the below that will be the toggle switch that will switch between the players two weapons.
