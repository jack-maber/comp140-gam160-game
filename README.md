**General Game Idea Overview**

My game idea will be centred around the player piloting a mech in an neo-80s style arena type area littered with obstacles and enemies trying to stop the player from defusing a number of bombs randomly placed in the arena, with the player's objective being to defuse the bombs before the individual timers run out and detract from the arena's health bar, with the amount of enemies increasing with every round, the player will have to face this onslaught using a variety of weapons and attacks until the health bar runs out and the arena is destroyed, the player is then left with a score that can be entered into the high score table and be used to compare their skill and prowess to their peers and provide a competitive element to the game.

**Core Game Mechanics**

Movement in the game will be handled in the normal FPS manner with the left stick handling the direction  of the character's movement while the right stick aims the mechs weapon, however the weapon can be rotated a full 360 degrees and can be aimed independently of the mechs legs, adding a new level of mobility unseen in a game of this type and completely changing the way the game is played.

The players main objective while in play is to defuse the bombs that are randomly placed around the environment at the start of every round, the way that these are defused is a small mini-game which takes place in real time so the player has to be smart about when they defuse, the mini game will require the player to hit a number of directional inputs in order under a time limit with the time left being displayed by a decreasing bar, and if it runs out the player will have to retry it with another set of randomly selected inputs to add to the challenge and the pressure, and adding variety to the gameplay, with the round ending either when all the bombs have been defused or exploded and dealt their damage. 

The other core game mechanic will be the arena's health bar system, where instead of dealing damage to the player and the game ending when they die, they will instead respawn after a set amount of time, letting the bomb timers count down and put the player under more pressure, the way the game will end is when the arena's health bar reaches zero, the player will be able to rebuild pieces and return health but it will take time and they will be open to attack while they are doing it.
